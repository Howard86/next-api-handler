## next-connect

[next-connect](https://github.com/hoangvvo/next-connect) is a middleware for Next.js that simplifies the creation of API endpoints by allowing developers to chain multiple middleware functions together. It seamlessly integrates with other Next.js features, such as server-side rendering and API routes, and supports TypeScript. [next-connect](https://github.com/hoangvvo/next-connect) reduces the amount of boilerplate code required and makes it easier to handle requests and process data.

Overall [next-connect](https://github.com/hoangvvo/next-connect) provides a similar but more powerful features than [next-api-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-api-handler). Its older version inspired the creation of [next-api-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-api-handler). Do check it out if you are looking for more powerful APIs.

## tRPC

[trpc](https://trpc.io) is a lightweight TypeScript-based remote procedure call (RPC) framework that simplifies the development of APIs and web services. With [trpc](https://trpc.io), developers can define their APIs using a simple and intuitive syntax and benefit from features such as type safety, automatic documentation, and code generation. [trpc](https://trpc.io) also supports both client-side and server-side validation, ensuring that data is always validated and sanitized.

[trpc](https://trpc.io) is a more powerful framework that provides a lot of features that [next-api-handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-api-handler) doesn't have, such as automatic documentation, code generation, and more. It has more required coding conventions and opinionated api design, but it's worth checking out if you are looking for a more powerful framework.
